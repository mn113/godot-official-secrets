# godot-official-secrets

This is a short one-level game about smuggling secrets, created with [Godot 4.3](https://godotengine.org/) for [Github Game-Off Jam 2024](https://resources.github.com/events/game-off-2024/) (*jam theme: __secrets__*).

The aim of the game is to find out secret information from colleagues in a dystopian government agency office building, and exfiltrate it to your handler. If the agency's suspicion of you rises too high, the game is lost.

## Play

The game is playable online at https://mn3monic.itch.io/official-secrets
